# Instantion Performance

These test's are based on a StackOverflow question called [Why is [] faster than list()?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30216000/why-is-faster-than-list). As the title suggests, it is faster to instantiate a list using `[]` than `list()`. The code in this folder aims to test that.
